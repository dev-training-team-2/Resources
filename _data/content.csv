The ultimate point of the mission of God is that all peoples of the earth would know God and recognize His glory being displayed most perfectly in His Son, Jesus Christ. God’s plan for His mission includes working through His redeemed people, the Church, to declare His glory—the weight of His perfect presence and character—and to make disciples of all nations.

As you journey through these pages, we pray you grow in your understanding of the mission of God and how He purposes the people of God to join Him in His redemptive plan—that a great multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language will know and worship our Lord Jesus Christ (Revelation 7:9).",PDF Store Resource,Foundations
